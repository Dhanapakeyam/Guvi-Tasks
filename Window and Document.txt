WINDOW:
    The JavaScript window object sits at the top of the JavaScript Object hierarchy and represents the browser 
window. The window object is supported by all browsers. All global JavaScript objects , functions, and 
variables automatically become members of the window object. The window is the first thing that gets 
loaded into the browser. This window object has the majority of the properties like length, 
innerWidth, innerHeight, name, if it has been closed, its parents, and more.

    The window object represents the current browsing context . It holds things like window.location, 
window.history, window.screen, window.status, or the window.document. Each browser tab has 
its own top-level window object. Each of these windows gets its own separate global object. 

DOCUMENT:
    Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object. 
The document contains the contents of the page. Using document object, JavaScript can modify, 
add and delete the HTML elements, attributes CSS styles in the page.

    The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document where as 
document object is property of window object that points to the DOM document loaded in that window.
